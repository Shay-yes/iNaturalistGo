# iNaturalistGo

### Running this application and its dependencies:
Our application has been deployed via Heroku! To run the application, simply head to inaturalistgo.herokuapp.com
The application still only features trivial functionality, but at this point presents a better representation of the app's layout. Upon entering the aforementioned site, the user is presented with the option to either "Log in" or "Create Account," which take the user to a mockup of the login page or the account creation page, respectively. At this time, there
is no viable way to view the "logged-in" home screen; this will be addressed in the next iteration.
